The robot is inside a scaled reproduction of the Monza's circuit. The main gol of the project is to drive the robot inside the circuit and it must avoid hitting walls. Also, there must be a User-Interface node thanks to an external user can increment/decrement the velocity of the robot and can also reset its position back from the start.
